The corrected CSS code includes a number before the percentage value in the `calc()` function:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 10px); /*Corrected*/
  /*or*/
  width: calc(100% - 10px); /*Another correct example*/
}
```

This ensures the calculation is performed correctly and the element is rendered with the expected width.  A common issue is to forget that the percentage is a calculation based on the containing element's width.  The value must be a valid percentage of something.
